Coffee aficionados from all over the world will be heading to Lisbon, Portugal, this September for the 2024 World AeroPress Championship.

In addition to the main competition — which is expected to feature some 60 national winners from all over the world — the WAC organizers are adding two features to this year’s program.

First is the WAC Roaster Village, where guests will be able to sample coffees served by highly regarded specialty coffee roasters from throughout Europe.

    description: '''
More than half a million coffee drinking glasses are being recalled after 56 burning and/or cutting injuries, some requiring stitches or surgery.

The single-wall glass mugs were sold in sets of six on Amazon and through JoyJolt’s website, with the model number JG10242, under the name JoyJolt Drinkware Declan Single-Wall Glass Coffee Mugs. The glasses were manufactured in China.

According to JoyJolt’s own recall and the CPSC notice, the glasses are known to break or crack at the base when coming into contact with hot liquids, such as coffee. More than 100 incidents of breaking — resulting in more than 50 incidents of burns, lacerations or other injuries — have been reported. Seven injuries have required professional medical attention, according to JoyJolt.

According to the JoyJolt website, the glassware brand was founded in 2014 by brothers Martin and Joel Mittelman after they “embarked on a mission to find high-quality, contemporary shot glasses at an affordable price,” yet “couldn’t find what they were looking for.”

    description: '''
A swashbuckling coffee company near the shores of Lake Erie called Calico Jack Coffee Roasters has raised the flag on its first brick-and-mortar cafe. 

A wall-size rendition of the company’s pirate cat logo greets customers entering the 1,238-square-foot shop, where a Slayer Steam EP2 espresso machine glimmers like a pirate’s sword and Mahlkönig grinders purr like kittens.

In the few short weeks since, Calico Jack replaced the shop’s chalk menu board with modern wooden slats, applied fresh paint inside and out, and replaced all the furniture, including with a custom live-edge slab for seating by the shop’s front windows.

High-top tables and chairs are coming in this week for an outside deck that’s nearly complete. The one remaining piece of the puzzle is the company’s Mill City Roasters MCR-1 machine, which Calico Jack Coffee Roasters Co-Founder Austin Barbian hopes will be cleared for relocation soon.
